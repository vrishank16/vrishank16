## About Me

As someone who's deeply curious about numbers and trends, I recently completed my Masters in Business Analytics from Victoria University. This degree has not just taught me how data helps drive business decisions, but also how it can be used to impact the world in a positive way. Previously, I had completed my Bachelor's (Honors) in Economics, which provided me with a solid foundation in understanding economic principles and their applications in the business world.

Moreover, I am currently interning at XIA Infinite Solutions as a Data Analyst, helping the company establish and provide tamper proof supply chain solutions to its clients. This endeavor along with my previous internship as a Business Analyst at Sweet by Nature has given me significant exposure on working with real-world data and generating insights. In my quest for continuous improvement, I have honed my analytical skills through self study and through certification courses. I completed a Business Analytics Professional Certification from AnalytixLabs which equipped me with proficiency in MS Excel, Python, SQL, and Tableau, enabling me to analyze and visualize meaningful insights from complex datasets. Over the past 2 years I have worked on various data analysis and ML projects that have helped me develop my technical skills.

As a dynamic individual, I thrive on challenges and am always eager to learn more about topics that pique my interest. My inquisitiveness goes beyond just the textbooks, as I like to keep informed about the world, especially in the fields of finance and geopolitics.
